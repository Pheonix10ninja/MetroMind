# MetroMind
MetroMind is a transit intelligence project that learns how long city buses actually take. It quietly collects live MTA bus data, records real stop-to-stop travel times by route, day, and time, and builds a growing memory of patterns. Over time, it uses this history to predict bus arrivals more accurately than schedules.
